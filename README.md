# Principles of Compiler Design

Collection of code from my compiler design course at CofC.

## Project 1
First assignment. The task was to create a small program that recognized tokens in the Triangle language (as defined in *Programming Language Processors in Java*), make whitespace blocks one whitespace and display errors if tokens were not recognized. 

## Project 2
In this project we were to add support for the entire Triangle language specification so that jflex would generate a Lexer, and a valid parser could successfully be generated using CUP. We would then print out the parsed triangle file using an XML format.

## Final
Provided with a functioning Triangle language compiler, we were tasked with adding support for the `repeat until` command.
