/****
 *
 * This is a simple stand-alone testing program for the Pascal lexer defined in
 * PascalLexer.JFLex.  The main method accepts an input file as its first
 * command-line argument.  It then calls the lexer's next_token method with an
 * input reader for that file.  The value of each Symbol returned by next_token
 * is printed to stanard output.
 *                                                                      <p> 
 * The following command-line invocation will read in the test program in the
 * file "lexer-test.p" and print out each token found in that file:
 *
 *     java TriangleLexerTest lexer-test.p
 *
